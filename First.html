    <h1>Biblical Insights: A Conversation</h1>
    <p>This page summarizes a discussion on various scriptures, including lifespan, the definition of 'score', forgiveness, tenacity, and self-defense.</p>

    <div class="verse-section">
        <h2>Lifespan and the Definition of 'Score'</h2>
        <p>The Bible offers a poetic description of the human lifespan, using a term that has historical significance.</p>

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+of+an+Older+Person" alt="A wise, older person to represent the passing of time.">

        <h3>Three Score and Ten</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Psalm 90:10:</strong> "The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."</blockquote>
        <p>The word "score" comes from the Old Norse word <em>skor</em>, meaning "a notch." It was used to count items in groups of twenty. Therefore, "three score and ten" means (3 x 20) + 10, <b>which equals 70.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div class="verse-section">
        <h2>Forgiveness</h2>
        <p>Jesus teaches about the importance of limitless forgiveness, using a powerful example. This section also explores the biblical teaching on what to do when a believer persists in sin.</p>

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+of+Forgiveness" alt="Two people shaking hands to symbolize forgiveness.">

        <h3>Seventy Times Seven</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Matthew 18:21-22:</strong> "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, <b>'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven times.'</b>"</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Distancing Yourself from Persistent Sin</h3>
        <p>Scripture also provides guidance on how to act when a fellow believer is living in unrepentant and persistent sin. This process begins with admonition and, if they do not repent, leads to a form of separation for their own good.</p>

        <blockquote><strong>2 Thessalonians 3:14-15:</strong> "If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>1 Corinthians 5:11:</strong> "But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people."</blockquote>

    <div class="verse-section">
        <h2>Tenacity and Perseverance</h2>
        <p>Tenacity in the face of adversity, and in doing good, is a recurring theme in scripture.</p>

        <h3>Key Verses</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 31:6:</strong> "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>Proverbs 24:16:</strong> "For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again, but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>Romans 12:21:</strong> "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>2 Thessalonians 3:13:</strong> "And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good."</blockquote>

    <div class="verse-section">
        <h2>Self-Defense and Non-Resistance</h2>
        <p>The Bible presents a complex view on self-defense, with some verses suggesting a need to be prepared for conflict, while others advocate for a non-violent response.</p>

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+of+a+Sword+and+Shield" alt="A sword and shield representing self-defense.">

        <h3>Defense and Preparedness</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Exodus 22:2-3:</strong> "If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the one who struck the blow will not be guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, the one who struck the blow will be guilty of bloodshed."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>Matthew 10:34:</strong> "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>Luke 22:36:</strong> "He said to them, 'But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.'"</blockquote>

        <h3>Contrast: Turning the Other Cheek</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Matthew 5:39:</strong> "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."</blockquote>
